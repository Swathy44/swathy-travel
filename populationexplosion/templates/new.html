<h1>Census</h1>
<p>Count of people of a country is called census. Census is an official numeration of population after every ten years in India, along with certain social and economic statistics. This not only helps us in knowing the total number of population but also the latest distribution of population, sex ratio, age composition, occupational structure and literacy of a particular country.</p>
